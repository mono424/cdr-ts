A robust TypeScript library for parsing data encoded in Custom Data Representation (CDR) format. This parser is schema-driven, allowing for precise and type-safe decoding of binary data, typically received as a base64 encoded string.

## üöÄ Features

* Parses CDR (Common Data Representation) data streams.
* Supports a variety of primitive types:
    * Integers: `int8`, `int16`, `int32`, `int64` (parsed as `number`)
    * Unsigned Integers: `uint8`, `uint16`, `uint32` (parsed as `number`), `uint64` (parsed as `number` or `bigint`)
    * Floating-point numbers: `float32`, `float64` (currently `float32` is fully implemented and tested for parsing)
    * `string` (UTF-8, null-terminated)
    * `string_bytes` (sequence of bytes, null-terminated, parsed as `Uint8Array`)
* Supports composite types:
    * `sequence`: Ordered list of elements of the same type (parsed as an `Array`).
    * `dictionary`: A collection of key-value pairs, where keys are strings and values can be any CDR type (parsed as an `object`). Fields are parsed in the order of their `index` property.
* Type-safe parsing: The structure and types of the parsed payload are determined by the provided schema, leveraging TypeScript's type system (`MapSchema` utility type).
* Handles byte alignment as per CDR specification.
* Parses the standard CDR header (representation identifier and options).
* Configurable maximum sizes for sequences and strings to prevent excessive memory allocation.
* Accepts base64 encoded strings as input for CDR data.
* Includes utility for creating and managing byte buffers.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

This project uses [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) as its package manager but you can use whatever package manager you like.

```bash
pnpm install @mono424/cdr-ts # Replace with your actual package name on npm
```

```bash
npm install @mono424/cdr-ts # Replace with your actual package name on npm
```

```bash
yarn install @mono424/cdr-ts # Replace with your actual package name on npm
```

Or, if you're working with the source code:

```bash
git clone [https://github.com/mono424/cdr-ts.git](https://github.com/mono424/cdr-ts.git)
cd your-repo
pnpm install
```

## üìñ Usage

To parse CDR data, you first need to define a schema that describes the structure of your data. Then, you can use the `parseCDR` function.

### 1. Define Your Schema

The schema defines the fields, their order (via `index`), and their types.

```typescript
import { CDRSchema, MapSchema } from '@mono424/cdr-ts';

type MyDataType = CDRSchemaDictionaryValue<{
  stamp_s: CDRSchemaDictionaryField<CDRSchemaIntValue>,
  stamp_ns: CDRSchemaDictionaryField<CDRSchemaUintValue>,
  frame_id: CDRSchemaDictionaryField<CDRSchemaStringValue>,
  data: CDRSchemaDictionaryField<CDRSchemaSequenceValue<CDRSchemaUintValue>>,
}>

// Define the schema for your data structure
const myDataSchema: MyDataType = {
  type: "dictionary",
  items: {
    stamp_s: { index: 0, value: { type: "int", len: 32 } },
    stamp_ns: { index: 1, value: { type: "uint", len: 32, format: "number" } },
    frame_id: { index: 2, value: { type: "string" } },
    data: { index: 3, value: { type: "sequence", itemSchema: { type: "uint", len: 8, format: "number" } } },
  }
};
```

### 2. Parse the CDR Data

Provide the base64 encoded CDR string and your schema to `parseCDR`.

```typescript
import { parseCDR, ParserOptions } from '@mono424/cdr-ts'; // or './src/parser' if local

const base64Data = "AAEAAAABAAAAAQAAAAZm9vYmFyAAAAAAAAAAAAPkAAABAAAAABAAAADHRlc3RfdGFnXzAxAAAA"; // Example base64 string

const options: ParserOptions = {
  maxStringSize: 1024,    // Default: 1024
  maxSequenceSize: 512,   // Default: 1024
};

try {
  const { header, payload } = parseCDR(base64Data, cameraPacketSchema, options);

  console.log("Parsed CDR Header:", header);
  console.log("Parsed Payload:", payload);

  // Accessing fields (types are inferred from the schema)
  console.log("Timestamp (seconds):", payload.stamp_s);        // number
  console.log("Timestamp (nanoseconds):", payload.stamp_ns);  // number
  console.log("Frame ID:", payload.frame_id);                  // string
  console.log("Data Length:", payload.data.length);            // number (length of Uint8Array sequence)
  // payload.data is Array<number>

  // Example specific assertions from tests:
  // expect(parsed.payload.stamp_s).toBe(1747238941)
  // expect(parsed.payload.stamp_ns).toBe(291125000)
  // expect(parsed.payload.frame_id).toBe("62")
  // expect(parsed.payload.data).toHaveLength(5456)

} catch (error) {
  console.error("Error parsing CDR data:", error);
}
```

Okay, here's the "Schema Definition" part, jazzed up with some emojis and a friendly vibe\! üéâ

## üìú‚ú® Schema Definition

Think of a schema as the magical map üó∫Ô∏è that tells our parser how to read your CDR data. It's like giving instructions to a super-smart robot ü§ñ: "This part is a number, that part is some text, and over here is a list of things\!"

By defining a schema, you make sure the parser understands your data perfectly and gives you back everything in a neat, typed, and predictable way. Let's dive into how you can create these blueprints\!

### üß© The Building Blocks

First, a few key terms you'll see:

  * `CDRSchema`: This is the big umbrella ‚òÇÔ∏è for any type of CDR data structure you can define.
  * `CDRType`: Represents any specific CDR type ‚Äì whether it's a simple number or a complex structure.
  * `CDRPrimitiveTypes`: These are your basic data types, like numbers üî¢ and text ÊñáÂ≠óÂàó.
  * `CDRLength`: For our number-loving types, this specifies how big they are in bits (like `8`, `16`, `32`, or `64` bit).

### Primitive Types: The Simple Stuff üç¨

These are the fundamental data types:

  * **Integer (`CDRSchemaIntValue`)**: For whole numbers\! ‚Ñ§

      * `type: "int"`
      * `len: CDRLength` (e.g., 8, 16, 32, 64)
      * Example: `{ type: "int", len: 32 }` (a standard 32-bit integer)

  * **Unsigned Integer (`CDRSchemaUintValue`)**: For whole numbers that are always positive\! ‚ûï

      * `type: "uint"`
      * `len: CDRLength`
      * `format: "bigint" | "number"` (Use `"bigint"` for those really huge `uint64` numbers that need extra space\!)
      * Example (regular number): `{ type: "uint", len: 32, format: "number" }`
      * Example (big boi number): `{ type: "uint", len: 64, format: "bigint" }`

  * **Float (`CDRSchemaFloatValue`)**: For numbers with decimal points.

      * `type: "float"`
      * `len: CDRLength` (Usually `32` for single-precision or `64` for double-precision. Our parser is currently best friends with `len: 32` for Float32\!)
      * Example: `{ type: "float", len: 32 }`

  * **String (`CDRSchemaStringValue`)**: For good old text\! üìù

      * `type: "string"` (Reads UTF-8 text that ends with a special 'null' character)
      * Example: `{ type: "string" }`

  * **String Bytes (`CDRSchemaStringBytesValue`)**: For when your "string" is more like a sequence of raw bytes.

      * `type: "string_bytes"` (Also ends with a 'null' character, gives you a `Uint8Array`)
      * Example: `{ type: "string_bytes" }`

### Composite Types: Building Cool Structures üèóÔ∏è

These types let you group primitive types (or even other composite types\!) together:

  * **Sequence (`CDRSchemaSequenceValue<K extends CDRType>`)**: An ordered list of items, all of the same type\! Think of it as an array. ‚û°Ô∏è[üì¶, üì¶, üì¶]

      * `type: "sequence"`
      * `itemSchema: K` (This is where you define the schema for each item in the list)
      * Example (a list of tiny unsigned numbers):
        `{ type: "sequence", itemSchema: { type: "uint", len: 8, format: "number" } }`

  * **Dictionary (`CDRSchemaDictionaryValue<K extends CDRSchemaDictionaryItems>`)**: A collection of named fields, like a JavaScript object or a real dictionary\! üìñ {üîë:üíé}

      * `type: "dictionary"`
      * `items: K` (An object where each key is a field name, and its value describes that field)
      * Inside `items`, each field is a `CDRSchemaDictionaryField`:
          * `index: number` (Super important\! Tells the parser the order to read fields, starting from 0 ü•áü•àü•â)
          * `value: T` (The schema for this specific field's value)
      * Example (a little dictionary with an ID and a name):
        ```typescript
        {
          type: "dictionary",
          items: {
            id: { index: 0, value: { type: "int", len: 32 } }, // First field!
            name: { index: 1, value: { type: "string" } }      // Second field!
          }
        }
        ```

### ‚ú® Magical Type Inference with `MapSchema` ‚ú®

Here's a really cool part\! When you give `parseCDR` your carefully crafted schema, it doesn't just parse the data; it also knows the *exact TypeScript type* of the payload you'll get back\! üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

This is thanks to a helper type called `MapSchema<T extends CDRSchema>`.

For instance:

  * If your schema says `{ type: "int", len: 32 }`, `MapSchema` knows the output is a `number`.
  * If it's `{ type: "string" }`, you'll get a `string`.
  * A `{ type: "sequence", itemSchema: { type: "int", len: 16 } }` will give you a `number[]` (an array of numbers).
  * And a dictionary schema? You guessed it\! An object with perfectly typed properties.
